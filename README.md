##### Do only whats required
Only do whats needed. Nothing less, nothing more. If you see something wrong or a room for improvement, ask permission beforehand for any deviations because if you think something is beneficial, this may not be the case with a different perspective, it may have side effects or simply it may be be very good but not needed at the time or at the cost of the current time. So simply ask lead/manager and discuss first.
